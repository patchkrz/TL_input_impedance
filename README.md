# TL_input_impedance

This repository contains data about the transmission line impedance formula. Here the reference document is Pozar, D.M. (2012) Microwave Engineering, 4th Edition. Test of the function is achieved by observing shor-circuit transmission line reactance and open circuit transmission line reactance.
